## Template code conventions

This repository manages two types of template code.

One is the template code for installation with the `.tpl` extension.
The other is the code that is the basis of the template written in JavaScript that exists under `src`.

The Server Side Tag runs on a JavaScript sandbox that runs on Google's Server Side Container. In order to publish the repository this time, it was necessary to realize CI at the GitHub level. Since the specifications of the language executed by Sandbox are almost compatible with JavaScript, we also manage the template code written in JavaScript code and the set of test code that operates by mocking the function provided as API.

You can first modify `src/template_code.js`, write the test code, and then update theã€€`.tpl` file only if it passes.

Check Google's [Server-side tagging APIs for Sandbox API](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/server-side/api) specifications.
